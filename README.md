How do I make sure I'm on the most recent version?
    This one is a little bit different. Remember - your repo might be running on a different version than the main repo.

If you want to pull the most recent version from YOUR repo, type in git pull git@github.com:(username)/(name_of_repo)
If you want to pull from the main repo to make sure that yours is up to date, go onto GitHub, find your personal fork, and there should be a button where you can sync your progress

How do I push my most recent commit up to GitHub?
    Go to your terminal, navigate to the folder the project is stored under, type

This ^ allows you to add all files into your commit Now type 
> git commit -m"This is where your message will go"
This ^ allows you to name your commit. This helps me to determine whether I want to accept or deny your commit. Now type 
> git push git@github.com:(username)/(name_of_repo)
